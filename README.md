### Abstract    

Understanding and participating in conversations has been reported as one of the
biggest challenges the hearing impaired face in their daily lives. These communication
problems have been shown to have wide-ranging negative consequences,
affecting the quality of life of these people and opportunities available to them in
education and employment. A conversational assistance application design was
investigated to alleviate these problems. The application uses automatic speech
recognition technology to provide real-time speech-to-text transcriptions for the
deaf and hard of hearing. To validate the method and investigate its usefulness,
a prototype application was developed for use in user testing. User testing was
performed with test participants representing the intended target user group. The
results indicate that the Conversational Assistant approach is valid and helpful.
Speech recognition accuracy, especially in noisy conditions, was identified as the
primary target for further development for increased usefulness of the application.
